🔌 Smart Plug Safety System with Custom Limits
Description:

A collaborative project with [Ahmad Hammoudeh], this smart plug system was designed with a strong focus on user safety and customization. Built around an Arduino Uno, the device features:

🔢 User-friendly LCD & Keypad for setting voltage and current limits

🔌 Relay control based on real-time readings

⚡ Current & Voltage sensors for accurate monitoring

⏰ Real-Time Clock (RTC) module for time-based functions

🔒 Circuit breaker integration for added safety

🔧 Input validation to prevent illogical or unsafe values

⚠️ 5A current cap to protect connected devices

🔋 AC-DC converter to power the Arduino from a 220V source

This project showcases core embedded systems skills, real-time decision making, and protective system logic—all essential for smart home device development.
